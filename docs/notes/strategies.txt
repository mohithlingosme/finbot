Strategies 
1. Bar Up / Bar Down strategy
 What: Trade based on directional single-bar or multi-bar patterns (strong bullish/bearish bars).
 Entry (example): buy after a strong bullish bar (close > open and close > previous high) with volume spike; short after a strong bearish bar.
 Exit/Risk: stop below bar low / use ATR multiple; target 1–2× risk.
 Pros/Cons: simple and fast; vulnerable to fakeouts in choppy markets.
 Timeframe: 1m–1H intraday or daily for swing.

2. Bollinger Bands strategy
 What: Uses bands around an MA to detect volatility, squeezes, and mean reversion.
 Entry: mean-revert — buy when price touches lower band and RSI < 30; breakout — buy on close above upper band with volume surge.
 Exit/Risk: stop beyond band or ATR-based; target mean/center MA or band opposite.
 Pros/Cons: versatile (trend & mean reversion); false breakouts and band hugging in trends.
 Timeframe: intraday to daily.

3. Bollinger Bands — Directed (directional variant)
 What: Uses band breaks but filters by trend direction (e.g., only long in uptrend).
 Entry: buy only if price > MA and close above upper band; avoid counter-trend band bounces.
 Exit/Risk: trailing stop (ATR) or MA cross.
 Pros/Cons: reduces false mean-revert trades by aligning with trend; misses contrarian high-probability bounces.
 Timeframe: 15m–daily.

4. Channel Breakout strategy
 What: Trade when price breaks a recent high/low channel (Donchian/price channel).
 Entry: buy on close above channel high with increasing volume.
 Exit/Risk: stop below breakout candle or channel mid; use breakout retest rules.
 Pros/Cons: captures big moves; many false breakouts — needs filters.
 Timeframe: intraday to daily swings.

5. Conservative Up/Down strategy
 What: Only take high-probability directional moves with strict filters (trend + momentum + volume).
 Entry: e.g., buy when above long MA, ADX>25, RSI rising above 50.
 Exit/Risk: tight stops, small position sizing, target conservative reward/risk.
 Pros/Cons: lowers drawdowns; fewer trades and slower gains.
 Timeframe: any (prefers higher TF for quality).

6. Greedy strategy
 What: Aggressive entries aiming to capture large moves (often partial scaling out).
 Entry: buy breakouts without heavy filtering or add on pullbacks aggressively.
 Exit/Risk: wider stops, scale out at multiple targets.
 Pros/Cons: can maximize winners but increases drawdown & risk of big losses.
 Timeframe: intraday to swing.

7. Inside Bar strategy
 What: Uses an inside bar (price range inside prior bar) as a compression/reversal or breakout signal.
 Entry: buy on breakout above mother bar high with confirmation; short on break below low.
 Exit/Risk: stop inside mother bar; target 1–3× ATR.
 Pros/Cons: low-risk entries (small stops); false breakouts common — use volume/filters.
 Timeframe: intraday to daily.

8. Keltner Channels strategy
 What: ATR-based channels around an EMA used for trend and breakout signals.
 Entry: buy on close above upper channel withADX>20 or trend filter. Mean-revert: fade touches near channel edges if trend weak.
 Exit/Risk: ATR-based stop; target channel mid or fixed R:R.
 Pros/Cons: smoother than Bollinger; less sensitive to volatility spikes.
 Timeframe: intraday to daily.

9. MACD strategy
 What: Uses MACD line, signal line, and histogram for momentum and crossovers.
 Entry: bullish when MACD crosses above signal and histogram turns positive; confirm with price above short MA.
 Exit/Risk: exit on cross back or divergence; use stop under recent swing.
 Pros/Cons: good trend-momentum combo; lagging in fast markets.
 Timeframe: 1H–daily usually.

10. Momentum strategy
 What: Trade in direction of strong price momentum (ROC, momentum oscillator, or filter like RSI > 60).
 Entry: buy after a momentum surge + volume, possibly on retrace to a dynamic level (VWAP/MA).
 Exit/Risk: ride until momentum weakens or use trailing ATR stop.
 Pros/Cons: captures strong moves; vulnerable to sudden reversals.
 Timeframe: short to medium term.

11. Moving Avg 2-line cross (Two MA cross)
 What: Classic system: fast MA crossing slow MA triggers trades.
 Entry: buy when fast MA crosses above slow MA; short on cross down. Add volume/ADX filter.
 Exit/Risk: reverse on cross back; stops via ATR or swing low.
 Pros/Cons: simple and mechanical; many whipsaws in ranges.
 Timeframe: adaptable (use shorter periods intraday, longer for swing).

12. Moving Avg cross (variant / typo “Avf”)
 What: Same concept but can include EMA/SMA/McGinley combos or multi-timeframe confirmation.
 Entry/Exit/Risk: similar to above; use higher TF trend filter to reduce noise.
 Pros/Cons: flexible; parameter sensitivity matters.
 Timeframe: multi-timeframe best.

13. Outside Bar strategy
 What: Outside bar = a bar whose range engulfs previous bar(s). It signals increased volatility and possible continuation/reversal.
 Entry: trade breakout of the outside bar in direction of momentum with a volume filter. Alternatively, fade if outside bar is exhaustion.
 Exit/Risk: stop inside the outside bar; target multiple ATRs.
 Pros/Cons: powerful setups; ambiguous direction — require context.
 Timeframe: intraday to daily.

14. Parabolic SAR strategy
 What: Uses SAR dots as trailing stop flip signals to enter/exit trends.
 Entry: buy when SAR flips below price; short when SAR flips above.
 Exit/Risk: SAR itself provides trailing stop; combine with trend filter to avoid whipsaw.
 Pros/Cons: excellent for trailing exits; whipsaws in ranges.
 Timeframe: trending markets (1H–daily).

15. Pivot Extension strategy
 What: Use daily/weekly pivot levels and extend them to project targets/resistance/support for entries/exits.
 Entry: trade bounces off pivot S/R or break of pivot with volume confirmation.
 Exit/Risk: stop beyond pivot zone; use pivot-based targets.
 Pros/Cons: widely watched, useful intraday; can be ignored in strong trending moves.
 Timeframe: intraday/daily.

16. Price Channel strategy
 What: Similar to breakout: trade within or breakout of price channel (e.g., rolling highest-high/lowest-low).
 Entry: buy on upper break for breakout; sell near upper in range for fade.
 Exit/Risk: stop inside channel; target channel width multiples.
 Pros/Cons: simple rules; false breakouts if not filtered.
 Timeframe: intraday — Turtles use daily channels.

17. Rob Booker — ADX breakout (proprietary)
 What: Rob Booker’s rules combine ADX and price pivots for breakout timing (proprietary trader system).
 Entry: buy if ADX indicates trend and price breaks pivot/support with confirmation.
 Exit/Risk: follow the specific author’s stops or ATR-based.
 Pros/Cons: can be effective in author's markets; requires study & backtesting for your instruments.
 Timeframe: often intraday/scalp setups.

18. RSI strategy
 What: Uses RSI for overbought/oversold, divergence, and momentum confirmation.
 Entry: mean-revert when RSI < 30 + price support; trend-follow when RSI crosses above 50 in uptrend.
 Exit/Risk: exit on RSI reversion or predefined R:R; use price structure.
 Pros/Cons: versatile; can stay overbought/oversold during strong trends.
 Timeframe: adjustable (Connors RSI for short-term).

19. Stochastic Slow strategy
 What: Standard Stochastic (%K/%D slow) for overbought/oversold and cross signals.
 Entry: buy when %K crosses above %D in oversold zone (<20) + trend confirmation.
 Exit/Risk: exit on opposite cross or target; can be choppy in trending markets.
 Pros/Cons: good for mean reversion; noisy in trends.
 Timeframe: short-term to swing.

20. Supertrend strategy
 What: ATR-based band that flips trend state; buy when price above Supertrend and vice versa.
 Entry: buy on candle close above Supertrend; combine with volume/ADX for confirmation.
 Exit/Risk: Supertrend provides stop; trailing on ATR recommended.
 Pros/Cons: clean signals in trends; late entry/exit in volatile breakouts.
 Timeframe: intraday to daily.

21. Technical Rating strategy
 What: Composite score from multiple indicators (MA, RSI, MACD, volume) aggregated into buy/hold/sell.
 Entry: take trade when composite score exceeds threshold (e.g., >70% buy).
 Exit/Risk: reverse or exit when score drops below threshold; raisable to portfolio-level signals.
 Pros/Cons: reduces single-indicator bias; black-box risk if weights not justified.
 Timeframe: any — great for screening.

22. Volty (Volatility) Expansion Close strategy
 What: Trade on a volatility-expansion candle close (big range candle compared to recent ATR) often signaling directional initiation.
 Entry: buy on close of volatility-expansion bullish candle with volume confirmation. Short with bearish candle.
 Exit/Risk: stop under candle low/high; target multiples of ATR or next structure.
 Pros/Cons: catches big moves early; false expansions can be liquidity grabs.
 Timeframe: intraday & daily.

23. Pivot Extension strategy (duplicate — if meant as variation)
 What: Use extended pivot targets and confluence (Fibs, VWAP). Trade breakout/retest of pivot extensions.
 (See 15.)
 Pros/Cons/timeframe: same as Pivot strategy.

24. Conservative variant & duplicates (e.g., “Supertrend strategy” appears twice)
 Note: duplicates indicate emphasis—conservative vs aggressive parameter sets matter. For a conservative Supertrend, use larger ATR multiplier and higher timeframe; for aggressive, tighten ATR and use smaller TF.

-.-.-..-...--Cross-cutting practical notes-.-.-..-...--
Filter combos: Pair a trend filter (ADX, MA slope, VWAP) with a momentum/volume trigger to reduce false signals.
Stops & sizing: Use ATR-based stops for instrument adaptivity; size positions by risk % of capital.
Backtest: Any strategy ∼must∼ be backtested on the instrument/timeframe and walk-forward tested to avoid curve-fitting.
Multi-timeframe: Prefer confirming higher-timeframe trend (e.g., daily) before taking lower-timeframe signals (e.g., 15m) for intraday trades.
Performance metrics to track: Win rate, average win/loss, max drawdown, expectancy, and Sharpe-like ratio.
