 What: sharp run-up (flagpole) followed by a small downward-sloping channel (flag).
 Entry/Stop/Target: enter on breakout above flag; stop below flag low; target ≈ flagpole height.

Rob Booker — ADX breakout (proprietary-style)
 What: uses ADX to confirm breakout momentum per Rob Booker rules.
 Entry/Stop/Target: only take breakouts when ADX>threshold; stops per author rules or ATR.
